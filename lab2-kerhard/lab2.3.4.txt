Observations

    Lab 2-3-1

        After adding the shadows to the draw platform function, I did not see
        much of a change in the frame rate, however, it did not go above 60 fps.
        I did see a change in the background when the shadows were added, there
        was a very visible line where the background was spliced together. 
        
    Lab 2-3-2

        This question was a great example for showing the importance of the 
        context.save() and context.restore() methods. Not only did it fix the 
        shadow attached to the character, but fixed the issue with the visible
        line showing where the background images met. At first, I added the 
        the context.restore too early, and it made all of the platforms black. 
        This mistake was a good learning experience as well, because now I
        understand where it needs to go.

    Lab 2-3-3

        I used the same image from Lab 1 on this question, but when I first
        tested it, the image continued seamlessly. I cropped the image to see
        exactly where the separation on the background would happen. When I 
        tested it, it was very obvious that the image was not the same on both
        sides.

    Lab 2-3-4

        I was expecting a little more of a change in frame rate by playing one 
        YouTube video, but it only went down to 56 fps. To stress the game a 
        little more, I played another one at the same time and it got down to 48 
        fps. This shows how important it is to pause the game temporarily when a 
        user's computer is running slow. It makes the overall experience when 
        playing the game much cleaner and more enjoyable.
