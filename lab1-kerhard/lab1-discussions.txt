Lab 1-1

    I found that scaling the image was a little tricky, only because the size
    of the image was different from the original image. What I did definitely 
    stretched the image a bit, but I didn't want to have to create a new css
    file for lab 1. This is definitely something to keep in mind for later in
    the semester, when we get to create our own game.

Lab 1-2

    Instead of changing the variables, I just created new variables. Another
    method I could have used was similar to the logic to draw the platforms, 
    adding a data parameter and passed in the variables from the platform data
    array. I didn't want to change the original code too much, because the 
    runner will always need to start on the first platform anyway.

Lab 1-3

    This exercise made me remember that web elements are drawn from the top
    left part of the screen, not from the origin. Working with 3D elements 
    definitely was the culprit of forgetting that.

Lab 1-4

    After switching the order of the runner and background, the runner was no
    longer visible. This demonstrated how layers work, which I have recently
    learned about from working with drawing software. The background was drawn
    over the runner since it was called after the draw runner function, 
    making the game impossible to play.

Lab 1-5

    The canvas definitely did not look the same after the width and height 
    values were specified in the css file. The author mentioned that when 
    you size the canvas with css, it only sets the size of the canvas, leaving
    the drawing surface at its default height and width, 300 X 150 pixels. 
    When set on the HTML element itself, it sets both the size and the size of 
    the drawing surface, so there is no mismatch between the two.
